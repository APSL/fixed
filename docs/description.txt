This package provides tools for building fast parsers of files
composed of fields width records where one of the fields in the record
specifies what type of record the line is.

The parsers built using this package yield named tuples containing the
information in each row.

The parsers are specified using a simple and succinct declarative
style:

::

  from fixed import Parser, Record, Field, Discriminator, Skip

  class Header(Record):
      type = Discriminator('H')
      row_count = Field(8, int)
      
  class Data(Record):
      type = Discriminator('D')
      source = Field(5)
      junk = Skip(10)
      destination = Field(5)

   parser = Parser(Header, Data)
